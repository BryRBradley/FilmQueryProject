## Project Goals 

1. To build a working application that met all requested utilities and tied together many of the topics we have been learning.
2. Connect the coding logic of SQL and Java exchanging to acces sdvid and grow my understandiong of SQL queries.
3. TO factor in and better understanding when and where to code in testing functions.

## Lessons Learned

*  I still need to test more and commit more. I go fart to long before confirming the code I have written and it got me 
into some confusion and spaghetti code issues.
* Continue to use the TA hours I think i learn just as much then and it helps me to cement the information I have 
learned through out the week.


## Coding Time and Testing
29 March - V1/V2 coded 1530 - 2030 90% of the coding was complete with minimal testing.
